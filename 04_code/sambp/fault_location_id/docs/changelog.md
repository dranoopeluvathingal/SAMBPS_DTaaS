# fault_location_id - changelog

Format: each entry is `YYYY-MM-DD - <stage / WP / decision-gate> - <summary>`.

## 2026-05-09 - S1 skeleton

- Created sub-project skeleton at `04_code/sambp/fault_location_id/`,
  mirroring the four sibling SAMBP sub-projects (`sync_oc`,
  `transformer_diff`, `line_diff`, `bus_diff`).
- Standard packages in place: `models/`, `inverse_estimation/`,
  `adaptation/`, `evaluation/`, plus repo-hygiene additions
  `docs/`, `tests/`, `.github/workflows/`, `outputs/`.
- Six phase-organised runners (`run_faultloc_phase{0..5}_*.py`) at top
  level, each pointing to the canonical execution plan in
  `docs/FaultLocationIdentification_ExecutionPlan.pdf` for scope.
- No algorithm code yet; module stubs carry WP-mapped docstrings.
- Git not yet initialised; that is S2.
